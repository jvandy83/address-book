# Address Book App

## Back-end Python-Flask App

### For Docker development:

1. Create SQLite tables

Open your python/flask repl:

    > flask shell

    >>> from db import

    >>> db db.create_all()
    >>> exit()

2.  Build and start docker container:

        > docker-compose build
        > docker-compose up

### For development without Docker

Activate virtual environment

For bash shell users:

    > source <rootdir>/backend/bin/activate

For fish shell users:

    > source <rootdir>/backend/bin/activate.fish

For csh shell users:

    > source <rootdir>/backend/bin/activate.csh

### Set your shell variables for Flask:

For Bash users:

    export FLASK_APP=app

For Fish users:

    set FLASK_APP app

### Create SQLite tables

Open your python/flask repl:

    > flask shell

Now, after you are in the python repl:

    >>> from db import db
    >>> db.create_all()

Exit the python repl and restart your server with command:

    > flask --app app --debug run

## Front-end React App (CRA)

Install dependencies:

    npm i

Start development server:

    npm start

## Warning, be gentle with this app!!! (LOL)

In order for things to function optimally, please create a full profile for each
"contact". I chose the hard way and created multiple tables for a person and an
address. Why did I do this? To make myself miserable, apparently.

All fields are optional. I didn't implement any error handling on inputs. But I
DO enjoy some input validation, let me tell ya.

I chose to focus on the fun stuff. Things that I thought might set me apparent
from a more novice person.

I DID struggle with interpreting cryptic errors in the flask console when
building out the backend. And of course, I spent too much time on occasion
trying to satisfy the TS compiler. I only used "any" once!!! Because I'm spent
now.

This app is responsive down to a tablet. Some mobile views look pretty good.
